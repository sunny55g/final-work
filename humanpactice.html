          "Human Practice is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work." - Peter Carr, Director of Judging, 2020 <br>
          <br>Our team has always believed that iGEM projects are meant to benefit humanity and our planet. Each project is driven by real-world issues and people, including ours. We aim to tackle a local problem with a sustainable solution, leveraging synthetic biology’s potential. Ultimately, we hope to inspire others to contribute to the greater good through science, research, and collaboration. (same vibes but change fully) <br>
          <br>Our project aims to produce sandalwood oil sustainably from PET plastic, but the journey to PETAL was marked by extensive exploration of other ideas. Initially, we split the team into two groups, each focused on using synthetic biology to address global challenges. One group, inspired by the Beeyeast 2023 Overgrad project, focused on using shRNA silencing to treat chytrid infections in amphibians in the Western Ghats. The other group looked into upcycling plastic waste through synthetic biology. <br>
          <br>Both groups worked closely with former iGEM participants and faculty to refine their ideas, creating detailed presentations and plans. During the Foundation Symposium’s biology week, we had the opportunity to present the chytrid project to Dr. Kunte from NCBS, an expert on Western Ghats butterflies, and Prof. Ullasa from IISER TVM. They explained that chytrid infections have declined by around 70% over the last four years, making the project less impactful than we had hoped. Moreover, the delivery of the therapeutic was a question, too. <br>
          <br>This feedback led our entire team to rally around the idea of valorizing PET plastic. However, the question remained: what should we upcycle it into? During our brainstorming, we found a groundbreaking paper by Joana Sadler, who had successfully upcycled PET plastic into vanillin. Her work inspired us to consider a similar approach, transforming plastic waste into high-value molecules. This approach reduces plastic waste and offers sustainable routes to produce chemicals that are otherwise derived from petrochemical sources. Hence, we aligned ourselves with her thinking but sought a plant-based metabolite in high demand yet low supply. <br>
          <br>Right around the time we were refining our idea, a news article in December 2023 caught our attention. Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL) announced that it would be importing 90% of its sandalwood oil requirements from Australia for its iconic Mysore Sandal soap. This hit close to home because Mysore Sandal soap is a household essential in India, and it felt ironic that we were importing the very oil that gives it its identity. <br>
          <br>Focusing on this issue made sense, especially since Indian sandalwood, prized for its high content of alpha and beta santalol, has become increasingly rare. This scarcity led us to reflect on why we are losing India’s fragrant ambassador and how we might address this by producing sandalwood oil sustainably with synthetic biology. <br>
          <br>In designing our Integrated Human Practices, we focused on ensuring that our project is both responsible and good for the world. We’ve worked hard to broaden the scope of our project while diving deep into every activity we’ve taken on. Throughout this process, we've focused strongly on people, considering ethical and moral considerations every step of the way. <br>
          <br>Our goal has been to explore and show how our project connects to the larger world around us. By creating feedback loops between our synthetic biology work and the world it impacts, we've embraced the Reflective, Responsible, and Responsive approach championed by iGEM.

                        KS&DL Karnataka Sandalwood Soaps and Detergents Limited, Bangalore 
                        A government enterprise producing sandalwood products, home to the iconic Mysore Sandalwood Soap of India. <br>
                        <br>During our visit to KS&DL, we aimed to learn more about the production and demand for sandalwood oil products, particularly the Mysore Sandal Soap. We inquired about a recent article that inspired us, and they confirmed the unfortunate situation: this year has been challenging, and we had to import from Australia. There's uncertainty about the availability of sandalwood oil in the coming years. This shortage poses a significant issue not only in Indian demand but also in exports. <br>
                        <br>Despite having well-established, fully electric soap-making machinery and a high demand for their products, the production requires a substantial amount of sandalwood oil. KS&DL also produces products with other essential oils, which can be more easily adjusted to meet fluctuating demands. However, this flexibility doesn't extend to sandalwood oil. <br>
                        <br>“We see a future for sandalwood soap, but it just isn't possible without the authentic Indian sandalwood oil.” <br>
                        <br>They were quite pleased after hearing about our project but raised concerns about its authenticity. They asked how our product's composition would differ from Indian sandalwood. We explained that it would be exactly the same as Santalum album, with an identical composition. They agreed that an additional source of sandalwood oil could be very beneficial.

               <h1 class="text-start mx-5">Dr. Nagendra</h1>
                 <p class="text-start mx-5">
                  <br> Human Resource Head, Sandalwood Oil Division, KSDL, Government of Karnataka Enterprise. The largest producer of sandalwood oil in the country. <br>
                  <br> To gain insights into the extraction process of sandalwood oil from the sandalwood tree, our human practices team traveled to Mysore to visit this government-run industry. Dr. Nagendra provided us with an in-depth look into the traditional methods used in producing sandalwood oil, the only facility in India dedicated to this craft. Established in 1916, KSDL boasts a rich history spanning nearly 108 years. The factory's aromatic presence can be detected kilometers away, but it masks some significant challenges. <br>
                  <br>Sandalwood oil production at KSDL has significantly reduced over the years, and the factory now operates only a few months a year, producing just enough to meet the needs of KSDL in Bangalore. Export is only possible if there is any excess. During our tour, Dr. Nagendra demonstrated the process, starting with the chipping of sandalwood logs into rough pieces and separating the heartwood from the sapwood. This is followed by feeding the material into ten 20-foot, coal-run distillers. Through this extensive distillation, pure sandalwood oil is produced. <br>
                  Sandalwood essential oil is extracted through traditional steam distillation methods, where the branches and leaves of the sandalwood tree are placed in an alembic. Steam passes through the material, vaporizing the aromatic compounds, and the resulting vapor is then condensed into an oil-water mixture. This mixture is subsequently separated to isolate the sandalwood essential oil <br>
                  <br>Over the years, the supply of sandalwood has drastically decreased. The factory faces a significant shortage of feedstock due to the limited sandalwood supply chain. Since the extraction process is resource-intensive and relies entirely on the precious wood, the high cost of procuring feedstock adds to the challenge. With limited sandalwood supply from plantation export units in India, the factory cannot operate year-round. As the largest producer, KSDL benefits from government policies that direct bulk purchases from auctioning at Marayoor. Despite this, the high cost of sandalwood means Mysore takes the majority share from these regions. <br>
                  <br> Dr. Nagendra validated our project's approach, acknowledging that our method is sustainable and does not rely on raw materials or feedstock. It also eliminates the need for hours of the distillation process. "It's time to change the technology- this is the new generation," he remarked. He did question our energy source, and we explained that our bacteria thrive on plastic. He found this approach both environmentally friendly and cost-effective.

                <h1 class="text-start mx-5">Mr. Ajit</h1>
                 <p class="text-start mx-5">
                  Municipality Plastic Collection Unit, Trivandrum. <br>  We visited a government municipality plastic collection unit in Trivandrum to understand how plastic waste management operates in metropolitan cities. At the Kazhakuttam unit, we spoke with Mr. Ajit, who oversees the operations there. <br>
                <br>Trivandrum has around 50 such collection units. Plastics are collected manually from households by the Harita Karma Sena. Once brought to the units, the plastic waste is sorted into different categories and then sent to main processing units located in other cities in Kerala, like Alappuzha and Kozhikode. <br>       
                <br>Mr. Ajit explained that all this plastic needs to be collected and transported to different cities for processing, which is not currently feasible. Sometimes, issues arise in the middle of the chain, disrupting the transportation and affecting the entire process. Establishing government processing units in every city will take a significant amount of time. He also pointed out that due to the lack of major plastic processing units within the city, people aren't encouraged to dispose of their waste properly. He emphasized the importance of starting waste management education from a young age, suggesting it be included in school curriculums. <br>
                <br>“I wish people knew proper waste management so that there's less waste,” he expressed. <br>
                <br>Inspired by this conversation, we decided to incorporate sustainable practices and waste management education sessions into our project.

                        <br>On our way to the waterfalls, we noticed a large plastic processing unit and decided to inquire about the private sector of plastic waste management. Abdul Vahid shared that their facility processes 8 tonnes of plastic daily, including 1 tonne of PET, collected from Vithura, Nedumangad, and Palode. This area spans approximately (insert area). Their processes include human-based segregation, machine chipping, and compression for compact packing and further transport. <br>
                        <br>He explained that while PET can be recycled only once effectively, losing its properties in consequent rounds, their approach involves upcycling PET by sending it to a Gujarat-based company (insert name). This company converts the compressed PET into nylon threads and t-shirts. This provides a good amount of incentives for better plastic management in the case of the general public as opposed to the government municipality. <br>
                        <br>“PET is unavoidable; 50% of it is made of crude petroleum, and recycling keeps it the same. It's still present in the environment AS PLASTIC.” <br>

                        <br>Private Sandalwood Cultivator in Hassan, Karnataka. <br>
                        <br>During a wedding attended by our team, we had the opportunity to speak with Ambika Vasudev, a private sandalwood cultivator and our team lead’s relative. In hopes of gaining insights into private sandalwood cultivation. Ambika has experience of 6 years and her plantation covers 5 acres of land. <br>
                        <br>Ambika highlighted the significant gap between the procurement prices offered by government agencies and the retail prices through which sandalwood is sold. This discrepancy serves as a disincentive for sandalwood farmers. Cultivating sandalwood is no small feat, requiring a considerable investment of time and resources. The trees take around 30 years to mature, and the risks associated with them are high. Moreover, the cultivation process is challenging due to the fear of smuggling and the lack of insurance schemes, so any case of robbery will fall straight on the owner. Sandalwood trees also require being planted with other species as they are hemiparasites. <br>
                        <br>“Basically a long-time investment but with lots of costs and risks.”

            <h3 class="text-start mx-5">Reasons to Approach:</h3> 
            <p class="text-start mx-5">
              We consulted Prof. Bohlmann due to his expertise in terpenoids and Cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are crucial for our project involving the production of santalene and santalol. His insights were sought to overcome challenges in the expression of santalol in our chosen chassis, as his chassis was E coli and yeast.

            <h3 class="text-start mx-5">Suggestions:</h3> 
            <p class="text-start mx-5">
              He suggested using the pCDF-duet vector system to facilitate the production of santalene, a precursor to santalol in Pseudomonas putida, too, just like E coli. Although on the other side, he expressed concerns about the difficulties of expressing Cytochrome P450, required for the production of santalol from santalene in Pseudomonas putida, noting that Cytochrome P450 is a membrane-bound enzyme and our chassis is a prokaryote that may struggle with the necessary post-translational modifications. He highlighted that this could make the process of expression of santalol more intensive and challenging.

             <p class="text-start mx-5">
              Following his recommendations, we integrated the pCDF-duet vector system into our chassis. For the cytochrome P450, we began exploring other comparable systems naturally found in (eukaryotic?) organisms or, that resemble the engineered E. coli variants.

            <p class="text-start mx-5">
              After an in-depth discussion and troubleshooting regarding the functionality of the pCDF-duet vector, Prof. de Lorenzo recommended developing our own constructs using the pSEVA vector system. The pSEVA system is designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy assembly and customization of genetic constructs, making it suitable for various applications in synthetic biology. He provided critical guidance on promoter selection, spacer sequence length, and ribosome binding sites (RBS), all of which are essential for optimizing gene expression. A key suggestion was to add an extended Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence next to the stop codon of the preceding gene to (for what). Prof. de Lorenzo validated our genetic insert designs, instilling confidence in the potential of our system and refining our approach, confirming the viability of our constructs.
